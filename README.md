# snooker

Final project for CS 174A

Snooker is a player vs player local pool game. It is inspired by the game pigeon 
    8-ball game and is designed for friends to compete and have fun. This game
    follows the official snooker game rule, such as the layouts of the balls on
    the game board. However, Snooker is a little bit different which users do not
    need to hit a red ball then a colored ball. Snooker only has 3 red balls and 6
    colored balls.
